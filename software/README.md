# Minibot Software
The software section of the Minibot is organized into specific folders, each serving a unique purpose, as detailed below:

**romer-minibot**: 
   - This folder contains the Pico library with wireless communication capabilities. 
   - Use this if your project requires network communication for the robot.

**romer-minibot-lite**: 
   - This folder contains a simpler version of the Pico library without wireless communication capabilities.
   - Use this version for offline or standalone functionality.

**MiniROS**:
   - This folder contains the ROS (Robot Operating System) part of the project.
   - Check this folder if you are integrating ROS into your robot project.
